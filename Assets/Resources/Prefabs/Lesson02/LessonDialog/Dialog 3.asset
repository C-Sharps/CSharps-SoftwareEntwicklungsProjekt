    This means that whichever we put as an input, it will find the correct method
    and write the input as its variable.


    You can try this yourself by making
    multiple instances of boxes and giving the constructor eather a number, a set
    of characters (this one needs to be in " " so that the method understands it
    is a string) or boolean (true or false) value.'
