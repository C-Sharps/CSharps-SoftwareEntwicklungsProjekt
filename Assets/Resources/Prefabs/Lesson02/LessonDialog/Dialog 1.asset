    in math they are placeholders for values. To save these you would normally give
    them their respective type and then assign a value. Some types are:


    Integer
    (int) for numbers

    String (string) for a set of characters

    Boolean (bool)
    for true/false


    Let us look at the Box.class for something more simple first.'
