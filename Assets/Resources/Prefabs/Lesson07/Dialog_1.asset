  dialogText: "Another essential technique when writing software is looping - the
    ability to repeat a block of code X times. In C#, they come in 4 different variants,
    and we will have a look at the for loop.\n\nIt's preferred when you know how
    many iterations you want, either because you know the exact amount of iterations,
    or because you have a variable containing the amount.\n\nHere is an example of
    the for loop.\n\nint number = 5;\nfor(int i = 0; i < number; i++)\r\n       
    Console.WriteLine(i);"
